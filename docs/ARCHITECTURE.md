# bigjsonl — Architecture

## Target Platform

- **macOS 15 (Sequoia)** — unlocks `@Observable`, `@Entry`, `ScrollPosition`, `Inspector`, and Swift 6 strict concurrency
- **Swift 6** — latest language with complete data-race safety
- No Linux or Windows support planned (SwiftUI is Apple-platform-only)

## Target Dependency Graph

```
BigJSONLCore  ←  zero external dependencies
     ↑                ↑
     |                |
bigjsonl-cli    BigJSONLApp
     |                |
swift-arg-     SwiftUI +
   parser        AppKit
                (system)
```

- `BigJSONLCore` has **zero dependencies** — only `Foundation` and `Dispatch` (system frameworks)
- `bigjsonl-cli` depends on `swift-argument-parser` (Apple-maintained, lightweight)
- `BigJSONLApp` depends only on system frameworks: SwiftUI, AppKit, UniformTypeIdentifiers
- The SwiftPM executable embeds `Sources/BigJSONLApp/Info.plist` in its Mach-O
  `__TEXT,__info_plist` section, disables automatic window tabbing, and opts into
  AppKit's regular activation policy, so Xcode launches it as a foreground GUI
  app with bundle metadata for `com.rajibsingh.bigjsonl`

## Data Flow

### Opening a file

```
User opens file
       │
       ▼
Store file URL (don't read yet)
       │
       ▼
Create empty LineOffsetIndex
       │
       ▼
Read first window of lines (viewport buffer)
       │
       ▼
For each line in window:
    ├── Parse with swift-json
    └── Append plain text and validity to line cache for display
```

### Scrolling (line N)

```
User scrolls to line N
       │
       ▼
LineOffsetIndex.hasLine(N)?
       ├── Yes → seek to byte offset, read window
       └── No  → byte-scan from last indexed position to N
                    └── Append entries to LineOffsetIndex
       │
       ▼
Read a bounded overscan window
       │
       ▼
Scroll geometry preloads and recenters the window before an edge is hit
```

### Search

```
User enters search query
       │
       ▼
Shell out: grep/rg --byte-offset --line-number <pattern> <file>
       │
       ▼
Parse capped output → [(lineNumber, byteOffset)]
       │
       ▼
Translate through LineOffsetIndex → absolute byte positions
       │
       ▼
Jump viewport to first match (or show result list)
```

## Key Components

### BigJSONLCore

#### FileIO

- Uses `mmap` via `DispatchData` for zero-copy access to file regions
- File is opened with `O_RDONLY` + `MAP_PRIVATE` — no write lock is held, so the app can safely view files being actively written by another process
- The mmap captures file size at open time; content appended after open is not visible until the file is reloaded
- No-copy `DispatchData` regions retain their `MappedFile` owner so the mapping cannot be unmapped while a returned slice is still alive
- Provides `FileRegion(url:, offset:, length:)` — a lightweight reference to a byte range
- Handles line-boundary detection (newline, carriage-return-newline, trailing newline edge cases)
- Exposes `totalFileSize` and `numberOfNewlines` (the latter from the index, not a full scan)

```swift
struct FileRegion {
    let url: URL
    let offset: UInt64
    let length: UInt64
    var data: DispatchData { get }
}
```

#### Indexing — LineOffsetIndex

- **Strategy: lazy incremental** — start empty, extend as the user navigates
- Scans mapped bytes directly through `MappedFile.withUnsafeBytes` to avoid
  copying each indexed chunk out of the mmap
- Tracks whether EOF has been reached; a line range is available only when its
  next-line boundary or the physical EOF is known
- Stores a sorted array of `(lineNumber: UInt64, byteOffset: UInt64)` pairs
- On `seek(toLine:)`: if the line is indexed, use it; if not, scan forward from the last indexed byte offset until the target line is reached
- `readWindow(fromLine:count:)` returns `[FileRegion]` — one per line in the window
- Index can be serialized/deserialized for future persistence but isn't persisted in v0.1

```swift
struct LineOffsetIndex {
    private var entries: [(UInt64, UInt64)]  // (lineNumber, byteOffset)

    mutating func ensureLineIndexed(_ line: UInt64, fileHandle: FileHandle)
    func offsetForLine(_ line: UInt64) -> UInt64?
    var lastIndexedLine: UInt64? { get }
    var lineCount: UInt64 { get }
}
```

#### Parsing — Token Stream

- Uses **swift-json** for per-line parsing
- `tokenize(_:)` produces a flat array of tokens ordered by byte position within the line
- `JSONFormatter.prettyPrinted(_:)` adds structural indentation and line breaks
  while preserving string contents, literal spelling, and object key order

```swift
enum TokenType: Equatable {
    case punctuation   // { } [ ] , :
    case key           // "keyName"
    case stringValue   // "some value"
    case number        // 42, 3.14, -1e5
    case bool          // true, false
    case null          // null
    case invalid       // raw text for malformed lines
}

struct Token: Equatable {
    let range: Range<UInt64>  // byte range within the line
    let type: TokenType
}
```

- For malformed lines: `tokenize` returns a single `Token` with type `.invalid` spanning the entire line. The line text is preserved as-is; no crash, no skip.
- The token model is **UI-agnostic** — both the CLI and SwiftUI app consume the same `[Token]` array and render it in their respective medium (ANSI codes vs. `AttributedString`).

#### Search — Grep/Rg Wrapper

- Auto-detects `rg` (ripgrep) on `$PATH`; falls back to `grep`
- Always requests `--byte-offset` and `--line-number`
- Caps subprocess output at the requested result limit (500 by default)
- Provides an async entry point that terminates the subprocess on task cancellation
- Treats subprocess status 1 as a successful search with no matches
- Result type:

```swift
struct SearchResult {
    let lineNumber: UInt64
    let byteOffset: UInt64
    let lineText: String
}
```

### bigjsonl-cli

- Single `@main` command with flags:

```
USAGE: bigjsonl <file> [--line <n>] [--search <pattern>] [--no-color]
```

- `run()` is `async` (`AsyncParsableCommand`); `renderWindow` reads, decodes, and
  tokenizes each line in the requested window concurrently via a `TaskGroup`
  (each line is independent and CPU-bound), then prints results in
  line-number order
- Renders lines to stdout with ANSI color codes derived from `TokenType`
- Shows a line-number gutter (e.g., ` 42 │ { ... }`)
- If `--search` is provided, opens to the first match and highlights matches inline
- If `--line` is provided, jumps to that line
- Pager mode: pipe through `less -R` automatically if stdout is a TTY

### BigJSONLApp

#### Tabbed interface

- `TabItem` (`id: UUID`, `url: URL?`, `document: BigJSONLDocument?`, `viewModel: DocumentViewModel?`) owns one tab's full state; a `nil` URL means an empty tab showing the welcome screen
- `DocumentViewModel` is owned by `TabItem` (not `ContentView`) so it survives SwiftUI re-renders and tab switches
- `BigJSONLApp` holds `@State private var tabs: [TabItem]`, `selectedTabID: UUID`, and `searchQuery: String`; `TabBarView` and the search toolbar are rendered above the active tab's `ContentView`
- `TabBarView` — horizontal strip of tab chips (filename or "New Tab"), × close button per tab, + button at the right end; scrollable when many tabs are open
- ⌘T opens a new empty tab; ⌘O opens a file picker with multiple selection — first file reuses the current tab if empty, each additional file gets its own new tab
- ⌘R (and a toolbar button) reloads the current tab's file from scratch via `TabItem.reload()`, which replaces the `BigJSONLDocument` and `DocumentViewModel` with fresh instances; search is cleared on reload
- Switching tabs re-runs the current search query against the new tab's view model automatically
- Closing the last tab resets it to empty rather than quitting, matching macOS convention
- Native `NSWindow.allowsAutomaticWindowTabbing` is left at its default; the custom tab bar makes system-level tab merging irrelevant

#### DocumentGroup with lazy loading

- Uses `DocumentGroup` for native macOS document integration (recent files, drag-and-drop, title bar filename)
- Overrides `read(from:ofType:)` in `BigJSONLDocument` — instead of loading file data into memory, stores the file URL and initializes an empty state
- `DocumentViewModel` (`@Observable`) manages the scroll position, viewport buffer, and search state

```swift
class BigJSONLDocument: ReferenceFileDocument {
    let url: URL
    let index = LineOffsetIndex()
    // read(from:ofType:) does NOT load file data — just validates existence
}
```

#### Scroll-driven viewport

- Uses `ScrollPosition` binding (macOS 15) for programmatic scrolling to search results
- Renders only a bounded overscan line window sized from the left pane height:
  roughly one visible pane plus one buffered pane before and after the current
  scroll position
- Viewport preparation runs in a cancellable detached task; indexing, decoding,
  and JSON validation happen off the main actor before the completed row window
  is published back to SwiftUI
- Within that task, per-line work for the requested window is split into chunks
  and read concurrently via a `TaskGroup` (one chunk per available core), since
  each line's mmap read, UTF-8 decode, and JSON validity check are independent;
  chunk results are reassembled in line-number order before the window is
  returned
- Continuous scroll geometry checks preload the previous or next window before
  the user reaches the loaded edge, preserving an estimated center line as the
  scroll anchor. Existing rows stay rendered while the next window is prepared,
  avoiding visible loading interruptions during normal line-list scrolling.
- A small viewport-load gate coalesces repeated edge triggers from trackpad or
  wheel momentum so a single gesture cannot queue several sequential window
  shifts while the user is trying to read the newly loaded rows.
- Each line is rendered as plain monospace text; viewport rows do not build an
  unused syntax token stream
- Viewport rows store bounded display previews instead of full line text; the
  inspector re-reads the selected full line from the mmap on demand
- Line rows are limited to three visual lines with tail truncation so a single
  large JSON value cannot dominate the scrolling viewport

#### Search

- Search toolbar lives in `BigJSONLApp` above the tab bar — outside the `ContentView` lifecycle — so the text field is never torn down on re-render or tab switch
- `searchQuery: String` is `@State` on `BigJSONLApp`; each tab's `DocumentViewModel` owns its own `searchResults`
- On submit, `BigJSONLApp` calls `selectedTab?.viewModel?.performSearch(query:)` directly; on tab switch, `onChange(of: selectedTabID)` re-runs the query against the new tab's view model
- Results (capped at 500) replace the line list in the left pane — retained
  result text is a bounded snippet, and `SearchResultsView` highlights the
  matched term in orange
- Clicking a result jumps the viewport to that line via `ScrollPosition`; results stay visible so the user can navigate freely between matches without re-running the search
- A × button in the toolbar clears the query and results on all tabs, restoring the line list
- Pane switching is driven off `searchResults.isEmpty` — no separate `searchActive` flag needed

#### Line inspector

- Metadata remains fixed above a full-height `Content` pane
- Valid JSON is pretty-printed and tokenized in a detached task so selecting a large record does not block the main actor; stale results are discarded
- Full selected-line text is read from the memory mapping on demand instead of
  being retained in every visible row
- The detached formatting task is cancelled directly, and formatter/tokenizer
  loops cooperatively check cancellation while processing large records
- Prepared content is retained in a one-entry cache for fast reselection without
  holding multiple content-heavy formatted records per tab
- An AppKit `NSTextView` renders a single attributed string instead of creating one SwiftUI `Text` node per syntax token; ASCII records use token byte ranges directly as UTF-16 ranges
- `\n` escape sequences inside JSON string values are expanded to `\n` + a real newline in the `NSAttributedString` after syntax highlighting, preserving token colours and JSON validity while improving readability of content-heavy records; the same substitution is applied in `LineView` for the line list
- Invalid JSON is shown unchanged and remains selectable
- Line 1 is auto-selected when a file opens so the inspector content pane is never empty

#### Malformed lines

- Visually distinct background tint (e.g., subtle red/orange)
- Indicator badge or icon next to the line number
- All text rendered as-is in a monospace font

## What's Not in the MVP (v0.1)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Index persistence to disk | Rebuilding per session is fine for v0.1; revisit if users report slow opens on very large files |
| ripgrep as a hard dependency | Auto-detect with graceful grep fallback — less friction for users who don't have rg |
| Line wrapping / soft wrap | Each line can exceed terminal width / window width; wrapping adds complexity. Deferred. |
| File watching (live reload) | Useful for log files but adds complexity. Post-v1. |
| Multi-file tabs | Shipped post-v0.1 as a custom SwiftUI tab bar. |
| Preferences UI | Colors, font size, etc. can be hardcoded for v0.1. |

## Design Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-06-15 | macOS 15 deployment target | Unlocks `@Observable`, `ScrollPosition`, `Inspector`, Swift 6. Audience of AI devs on recent Macs. |
| 2026-06-15 | Lazy incremental line-offset index | Minimizes startup time — no upfront scan. Index grows as user navigates. |
| 2026-06-15 | swift-json for JSON parsing | Streaming-friendly, fast, no Foundation dependency in the parsing path. |
| 2026-06-15 | Shared Token/TokenType model in core | Both CLI and SwiftUI app consume the same token stream; each renders in its own medium. |
| 2026-06-15 | DocumentGroup for SwiftUI app | Worth the extra work — gives native macOS document integration (recent files, drag-drop, title bar). |
| 2026-06-15 | grep/ripgrep search via subprocess | Avoids implementing search internally. System utilities are fast, well-tested, and handle edge cases. |
| 2026-06-15 | mmap via DispatchData for file access | Zero-copy windowed reads — no unnecessary memory allocation for visible lines. |
| 2026-06-15 | Raw UTF-8 byte tokenizer instead of swift-json AST walking | swift-json doesn't preserve source byte positions. Tokenizer validates with swift-json, then scans raw bytes for accurate positions. |
| 2026-06-15 | `MappedFile` maps entire file, `DispatchData` references sub-regions | Single mmap avoids per-region overhead. Each no-copy region retains the mapping owner without deallocating the mapped pointer. |
| 2026-06-15 | Trailing newline at EOF doesn't create a line entry | Prevents off-by-one when the last byte of the file is `\n`. |
| 2026-06-15 | Line ranges require lookahead or confirmed EOF | Prevents a partially indexed boundary line from reading through the remainder of a large file. |
| 2026-06-15 | Search results are capped and asynchronously cancellable | Keeps broad searches from blocking the app or consuming memory proportional to all matches. |
| 2026-06-16 | Scroll navigation uses bounded overscan windows | Continuous scroll geometry preloads the next or previous buffered window before the user reaches an edge, while the visible rows remain rendered during the background load. |
| 2026-06-15 | Inspector preparation runs off the main actor and uses AppKit text rendering | Keeps selection responsive for content-heavy records while preserving selectable syntax-highlighted output. |
| 2026-06-15 | Search results replace the line list in the left pane rather than a separate column | Avoids invasive `NavigationSplitView` restructuring; the existing two-column layout (line list + inspector) is preserved with a clean swap. |
| 2026-06-15 | Custom SwiftUI tab bar rather than native `NSWindow` automatic tabbing | Native tabbing treats each tab as a separate `WindowGroup` window, making shared tab bar state and the "new tab → welcome screen" flow impractical. Custom tab bar keeps all state in one place. |
| 2026-06-15 | CLI formula shipped to `Sepoy-Software/tap`; Cask deferred | CLI can build without code signing. GUI Cask requires Apple Developer ID cert, CI notarization, and a signed release archive. |
| 2026-06-16 | `DocumentViewModel` owned by `TabItem`, not `ContentView` | `ContentView` carries `.id(tab.id)` and is torn down on tab switch; owning the view model in `TabItem` keeps search results, scroll state, and inspector cache alive across switches. |
| 2026-06-16 | Search toolbar lifted to `BigJSONLApp`, `searchQuery` as top-level `@State` | Text field inside `ContentView` was destroyed mid-keystroke on re-render. Moving it outside the tab lifecycle gives a stable owner for the shared query string. |
| 2026-06-16 | `\n` expansion applied post-tokenization in `NSAttributedString`, not in `prettyPrinted` | Inserting real newlines inside string values during formatting breaks JSON validity and confuses the tokenizer. Doing it as a find-replace on the finished attributed string preserves colours and correctness. |
| 2026-06-16 | `O_RDONLY` + `MAP_PRIVATE` mmap — no write lock held | Files being actively written by another process can be safely viewed. New content appended after open is not visible until ⌘R reload, which replaces the mapping entirely. |
| 2026-06-16 | Viewport preparation and inspector formatting are cancellable background work | Keeps scrolling, resizing, tab changes, and rapid line selection responsive for content-heavy records. |
| 2026-06-16 | Viewport line reads parallelized via `TaskGroup` within the detached preparation task | Each line's mmap read, decode, and JSON validity check is independent and CPU-bound; `MappedFile` (`@unchecked Sendable`, read-only mmap) and `LineOffsetIndex` (`Sendable` value type) are safe to read concurrently, so splitting the window across cores speeds up large windows without added data-race risk. |
| 2026-06-16 | CLI `renderWindow` tokenizes its line window via `TaskGroup`, `BigJSONL` became `AsyncParsableCommand` | Tokenization is the expensive, independent per-line step; printing stays strictly ordered and sequential after the parallel pass so stdout output is unaffected. `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform` was tried first but triggers Swift 6 strict-concurrency warnings on mutable captures; `TaskGroup` matches the pattern already used for viewport loading and has no such warnings. |

## Distribution

### Homebrew CLI formula

The CLI is available via the `Sepoy-Software/tap` Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap Sepoy-Software/tap
brew trust sepoy-software/tap
brew install bigjsonl
```

The formula lives at `Formula/bigjsonl.rb` in [Sepoy-Software/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/Sepoy-Software/homebrew-tap). It builds from the tagged source archive (`v0.1.0`), requires Xcode 16+ at build time, and enforces the macOS 15 deployment target.

### Homebrew Cask (pending)

The GUI app requires a signed and notarized `.app` bundle to avoid Gatekeeper dialogs on first launch. Prerequisites before publishing the Cask:

- Apple Developer account and a valid Developer ID Application certificate
- A CI signing and notarization step (e.g., GitHub Actions with `xcrun notarytool`)
- A versioned `.dmg` or `.zip` archive hosted as a GitHub release asset

Once those are in place, add `Casks/bigjsonl.rb` to the tap pointing at the signed archive.
